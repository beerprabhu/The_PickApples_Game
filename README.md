# TheAppleGame
Last one to pick the Apple loses the game.

## The algorithm works on delicate handler methods and synchronization.

In this app, you have to pick Apple. Whoever picks the last Apple loses the game. Multithreading is achieved with synchronization so that only one player is allowed to pick the matchstick(s) while avoiding deadlock! Must try.
The code can handle any exception and App Not Responding errors without compromising the user experience.
